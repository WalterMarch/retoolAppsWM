## Argonautica

*Argonautica* is a simple application that allows the user to upload a JSON file, edit it, and then download the edited version (potentially with a new name).

Argonautica, originally, was the name of a poem about Jason (you know, because you are working with JSON files) and the Argonauts. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica) for information or [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm) to read it.

### TODO

* pie-in-the-sky - put the JSON editor in a tabbed control and have another tab be a set of components to make editing the JSON more user friendly.
